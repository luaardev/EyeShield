Data Transmission Between two devices using Sound.</br>
Tramission of data from one device to another using sound wave.
Data Transfer Over sound waves.

# Requirements:

python3

```
pydub
librosa
matplotlib
numpy
dtw
```

# Flow of project

```
1. From one device user enter a text input by running Encode.py file.
2. As a output it will give you .wav sound file.
3. Second device will listen it. or we can enter path as well if we have that sound file.
4. that sound will split into subsounds for analysis.
5. compare sounds using matplotlb.
6. if difference of sound == 0 you will get input text as a output.
```

python Encode.py
python Decode.py
